            <h3>What is LiquidBounce?</h3>
            <div class="textblock justify">LiquidBounce is a so-called hacked client for the game Minecraft. In a nutshell, a modded client like LiquidBounce allows you to do certain things regular players are 
                not able to do. What makes LiquidBounce special compared to similar clients is its Forge compatibility, which enables you to use it with any other mod you like.</div>

            <h3>How to Install LiquidBounce?</h3>
            <div class="textblock justify">
                1.) Download LiquidBounce from below and unzip the archive to your hard drive.<br>
                2.) Download and install <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/">Forge</a> for Minecraft 1.8.0 OR 1.12.2, depending on which LiquidBounce you want to use.<br>
                3.) Open your .minecraft directory (Usually located at %appdata%/.minecraft) and create a folder called "mods" if there is not one already.<br>
                4.) Copy the LiquidBounce Jar-File into the mods folder.<br>
                5.) Run Minecraft and select the profile, Forge created when installing and start the game.<br>
